# project-group_19 - Disease Prediction App
Welcome to our project, Disease Prediction App. We predictes the risk of bunch of diseases using knowledge based artificial intelligence. We predicted the risk of following threats:
- Diabetes Risk
- Maternal Health Risks
- Heart Attack Risk
- Stroke Risk

We took some input from our users and suggested them if they are in high or lower risk of these diseases.

## üõ† How to run our project?

> - Clone this project in a new folder
> - Run the app.py file
> - Install necessary dependencies
> - Tada! You are ready to go!

## ‚ö° Acknowledgement
Thanks to almighty, finally  we finished our project. This journey was impossible without some peoples help.
First, we would like to express our gratitude to our course teacher Enamul Hassan, who has allowed us to take on this project, for his continuous support and guidance.

We would also like to thank the following individuals, without whom the completion of this project would not have been possible.
- Kawchar Husain, CSE-18, for helping us debug our messy codes and helping us with the basics of neural network
- Nihal Baig, CSE-18, for his warm attitude and guidelines
- Nazmus Sadat Shohag, CSE-18, for his feedback and suggestions on the initial UI
- Debapriya Dhar, CSE-18, for overall supports

Also, we want to thank the internet community from which we have received countless help and advice in dealing with various issues that had risen while working on this project.
